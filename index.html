The goal of this website is for students in Nanotechnology Engineering to be able to get any help that they need. As we all know, sometimes going to office hours or help sessions or WEEF TA's can only help so much. Sometimes you just need to see the answer and work backwards to figure out the pattern. That's what Engineering is all about! So on this site I, a current first year in 1B working through the program, will post everything I possibly can related to courses above. Keep in mind I can only post the things I have and that are considered to be my property. I will include things like the finals and midterms I did with the solutions that I have available to me. I will include all assignments, NOT WITH THE INTENTION TO ALLOW FOR COPYING but simply as inspiration or even a first step on how to proceed. One of my fellow classmates will include her notes that she took as PDF in case you happen to miss a lecture or 2, as we all do ;). I will include the cheatsheets that we were allowed, I will include answers to practice questions to the best of my ability. I hope this site helps with your education and remember not to just copy and hand it in as you will get caught and by cheating you are only cheating yourself. </strong>
