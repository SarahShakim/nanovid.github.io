        <center><h2>If I am being honest, I have no idea what I can even put up for this class. It is not meant to be difficult and Dr. Howard Sui has made it so that it is not. Simply pay attention in class, follow his directions and there is no way you should not get atleast a 50 in this class. Good luck with this one, I am certain you are all competent enough to handle his one yourselves. </h2></center>
